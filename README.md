# â€” Project for FACULTY... ðŸ’»
This project was carried out in a group, with the objective of creating a website within the E-Waste theme (electronic waste).
<br><br>
We used only HTML and CSS to develop the site, since the class theme was about the first contact with web design. According to the participants' meetings and expectations, I was responsible for developing:
<br><br>
<i>
â€” Site Template (footer, navbar, color pattern, images)<br>
â€” Form Tab<br>
â€” Primary homepage design</i>
<br><br>
The objective at first was just to create a website related to the theme, but during the project we concluded that it would be important to create methods, so that it was possible to monetize the idea and create systems of interaction with the public and partners.
